all-choices
Gir highlights each commit based on the chosen command; here each of the first six commits has a different command to show all possible row colors.

all-pick
By default (in most circumstances) every commit will start with the "pick" command, so this is what gir will look like when first started.

help
Gir is entirely keyboard-driven; pressing <kbd>F1</kbd> shows a list of the available hotkeys.
